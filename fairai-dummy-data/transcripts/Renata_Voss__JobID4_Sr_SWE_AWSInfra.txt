Recruiter: Hi again, Renata. Let’s talk about the Sr. SWE role on the AWS Infrastructure Services team. This team builds software to monitor, scale, and automate AWS data centers globally.
Renata: Sounds like a perfect match. I’ve worked closely with data center ops teams before, particularly during my time at PayPal when we built tooling for physical device health and uptime.
Recruiter: Let’s begin with an example. Can you walk me through a project where you led the architecture of a high-availability system?
Renata: Sure. At Adobe, we built an internal identity system that handled login, SSO, and MFA for over 10,000 employees. It needed 5 9s availability. I led the design using a dual-region active-active deployment. Each region had load balancers, replicated RDS clusters, and Lambda-based failover checks.
We used Route 53 health checks for global DNS routing and introduced chaos engineering tests monthly. The system ran with 0 downtime for 18 months.
Recruiter: That’s very impressive. We use CloudFormation and increasingly Terraform. Do you have a preference?
Renata: I started with CloudFormation, and it’s great for AWS-native use, but I prefer Terraform now. Its modularization and state tracking make collaboration easier. I’ve built modules for IAM policies, ECS services, and VPCs. I also integrated Sentinel policies for compliance.
Recruiter: Let’s talk scale. How do you design systems that grow gracefully?
Renata: I plan for horizontal scaling. Stateless services, sharded data stores, and event-driven pipelines are my foundation. I set up autoscaling based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics like queue length. I also use ALB with path-based routing to split traffic.
And I regularly review bottlenecks and update designs using simulated stress environments.
Recruiter: How do you ensure reliability during deployments?
Renata: Canary deployments, feature flags, and deployment rings. I integrate health checks into deployment scripts and use metrics to decide when to roll forward or back. I also implement runbooks and ensure we have solid observability.
Recruiter: Any experience with physical systems or IoT?
Renata: Yes. At Intel, I worked on a distributed logging tool used on embedded devices. We had to handle variable connectivity, so we used local buffering and retries. I also helped integrate power monitoring APIs into a dashboard for facility managers.
Recruiter: You’ve got a diverse toolkit. How do you coach engineers who are struggling?
Renata: First, I listen—what are they finding hard? Then I set micro-goals and schedule regular 1:1s. I give feedback early, celebrate small wins, and share my own struggles to normalize the process. I’ve seen solid engineers bloom this way.
Recruiter: Excellent. Any final thoughts on why this role?
Renata: AWS Infra is the backbone of cloud computing. I enjoy building systems that help other engineers move faster, with less pain. If I can make the cloud invisible to developers, I know I’ve done my job.
Recruiter: Couldn’t agree more. Thank you, Renata. You’ll hear from us shortly!
